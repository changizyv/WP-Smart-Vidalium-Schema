# Vidalium Smart Schema

**Vidalium Smart Schema** is a powerful WordPress plugin designed to enhance **Generative Engine Optimization (GEO)** by automatically generating and managing structured data (JSON-LD) for WordPress pages, posts, and custom post types. Built with performance in mind, the plugin leverages an innovative content analysis algorithm to suggest and apply schema.org types (e.g., Article, Product, FAQPage) with minimal server load, making it ideal for shared hosting environments. This project showcases advanced SEO techniques tailored for AI-driven search engines, ensuring content is discoverable and optimized for modern search experiences.

## Why This Matters for GEO
In the era of generative search engines (e.g., ChatGPT, Perplexity), structured data is critical for making content easily interpretable by AI models. Vidalium Smart Schema automates the creation of JSON-LD schemas, improving content discoverability and enhancing visibility in AI-driven search results. Its **intelligent content analysis algorithm** identifies patterns in HTML, URLs, and Elementor widgets without requiring resource-heavy dependencies like Python, delivering high accuracy with minimal server impact.

## Key Features
- **Intelligent Content Analysis**: A custom algorithm analyzes DOM structures, keywords, URLs, and Elementor widgets to suggest relevant schemas (e.g., FAQPage, Product) with scores based on text length, keywords, HTML structure, and more.
- **Lightweight Performance**: Optimized for shared hosting, requiring no external dependencies and processing up to 100 DOM nodes efficiently.
- **Schema Support**: Supports 24 schema.org types, including Article, Product, FAQPage, and LocalBusiness, with a limit of 5 schemas per page.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Admin panel for settings, page preview for schema selection, and conflict reports for easy management.
- **RTL Support**: Initial support for right-to-left languages like Persian via CSS.
- **Modular Design**: Built for extensibility, with future plans for integration with large language models (LLMs).
